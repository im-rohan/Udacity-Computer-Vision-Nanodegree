# Project : Landmark Detection & Robot Tracking (SLAM)

## Description

In this project, we implement SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping for a 2 dimensional world.
We combine robot sensor measurements and movement to create a map of an environment from only sensor and motion
data gathered by a robot, over time. 

SLAM gives us a way to track the location of a robot in the world in real-time and identify the locations of landmarks such as buildings, trees, rocks, and other world features.

This is an active area of research in the field of robotics and autonomous systems.
